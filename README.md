# Night Hacks
Collection of mini projects completed as demos for KWK WebDev Scholars. Source code can be accessed through this repl.it link (to be posted soon)

## Day 1: About Me Page 
For today's first mini project, scholars were prompted to create a mini "About Me" page about a partner that included a photo, 3 facts, and a link to any site. Here is a small example of my page.

## Day 2: Photo Gallery
Scholars were given an introduction on styling using CSS and Flexboxes for responsive design on webpages. Their night hack is to make a photo gallery on any topic they were interested in. For my example, I made an Animal Crossing themed gallery!
