# Night Hacks
Collection of mini projects completed as demos for KWK WebDev Scholars. Source code can be accessed through this repl.it link (to be posted soon)

## Day 1: About Me Page 
For today's first mini project, scholars were prompted to create a mini "About Me" page about a partner that included a photo, 3 facts, and a link to any site. Here is a small example of my page.

## Day 2: Photo Gallery
Scholars were given an introduction on styling using CSS and Flexboxes for responsive design on webpages. Their night hack is to make a photo gallery on any topic they were interested in. For my example, I made an Animal Crossing themed gallery!

## Day 3 && 4: Javascript Fundamentals
Scholars learned the fundamentals of Javascript alongside learning important programming concepts like arrays, boolean values, objects, and variable declarations. For these night hacks, they were prompted to complete some mini javascript exercises. 

As for advanced concepts, they also are able to complete the "Javascript Extension Challenges" 
Solution for some can be found under [this repository](https://github.com/mpara0/JS-Code-Challenges)
